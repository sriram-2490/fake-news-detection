## Overview
This project implements a Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning. The goal of the system is to classify news articles as either "REAL" or "FAKE" based on the content of the text. It utilizes the **Passive-Aggressive Classifier** algorithm and **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorizer for text processing and feature extraction.

The application is built with **Flask** as the web framework, allowing users to input text through a simple web interface and get predictions on whether the news article is real or fake.

## Features
- Web-based user interface to input news content.
- Fake News detection using a machine learning model.
- Easy-to-use system with real-time predictions.
- The backend uses Python, Flask, and the trained machine learning model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for the backend logic.
- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework to build the application.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library used for machine learning algorithms (Passive-Aggressive Classifier).
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Used for text vectorization.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for creating the web interface.
- **Pandas**: Library to handle and preprocess the dataset.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed:
- **Python** (Version 3.x)
- **pip** (Python package installer)
